# Description
	Utility to create delivery commands for Harvest.
	The idea is to leave it as simple as it must be. 
	You just need to fill up the form - top part, and hit the button, then the scripts will be generated. There are 8 steps that must be followed to migrate your changes to a central repository. Copy each one and paste it in your terminal (step by step); And, that's all.

# Variables
	You will see the variables below inside the code. You must replace them to your values.
	
	YOUR_PROJECT_PATH - The path where your project is.
	YOUR_BROKER  	  - The broker your project has been using to access Harvest.
	PATH_TO_HARVEST_CREDENTIALS	- The path where you got your Harvest credential stored.

# Feel free to fork it and convert the code to others SCM, like: SVN, CVS and so forth..
